# core.v1.gcePersistentDiskVolumeSource

"Represents a Persistent Disk resource in Google Compute Engine.\n\nA GCE PD must exist before mounting to a container. The disk must also be in the same GCE project and zone as the kubelet. A GCE PD can only be mounted as read/write once or read-only many times. GCE PDs support ownership management and SELinux relabeling."

## Fields

### fn withFsType

```ts
withFsType(fsType)
```

"fsType is filesystem type of the volume that you want to mount. Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system. Examples: \"ext4\", \"xfs\", \"ntfs\". Implicitly inferred to be \"ext4\" if unspecified. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#gcepersistentdisk"

### fn withPartition

```ts
withPartition(partition)
```

"partition is the partition in the volume that you want to mount. If omitted, the default is to mount by volume name. Examples: For volume /dev/sda1, you specify the partition as \"1\". Similarly, the volume partition for /dev/sda is \"0\" (or you can leave the property empty). More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#gcepersistentdisk"

### fn withPdName

```ts
withPdName(pdName)
```

"pdName is unique name of the PD resource in GCE. Used to identify the disk in GCE. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#gcepersistentdisk"

### fn withReadOnly

```ts
withReadOnly(readOnly)
```

"readOnly here will force the ReadOnly setting in VolumeMounts. Defaults to false. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#gcepersistentdisk"
